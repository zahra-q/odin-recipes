        <h3> Alfredo Recipe </h3>

        <p>
            Fettucine Alfredo is a pasta dish consisting of fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese, which melt and emulsify to form a rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.
            Originating in Rome in the early 20th century, the recipe is now popular in the United States and other countries. Outside of Italy, cream is sometimes used to thicken the sauce, and ingredients such as chicken, shrimp, salmon or broccoli may also be added when it is served as a main course.
